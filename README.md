# ♾️ SECI 1013 Discrete Structure
## ❓ Synopsis
This course introduces students to the principles and applications of discrete structure in the
field of computer science. The topics that are covered in this course are set theory, proof
techniques, relations, functions, recurrence relations, counting methods, graph theory, trees
and finite automata. At the end of the course, the students should be able to use set theory,
relations and functions to solve computer science problems, analyze and solve problems using
recurrence relations and counting methods, apply graph theory and trees in real world problems
and use deterministic finite automata finite state machines to model electronic devices and
problems.

> This is the last assignment of the semester, so we all treated it very seriously, checked and checked before submitting. Hopefully our hardwork can be paid off hahahaha.

## 🪞 Reflection
This course is kind of like extension to mathematics I've learned during high school. I gained deeper understanding on topics like functions, probability and graphs now.
